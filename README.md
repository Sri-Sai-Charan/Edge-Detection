# Edge-Detection
Edge detection includes a variety of mathematical methods that aim at identifying edges, curves in a digital image at which the image brightness changes sharply or, more formally, has discontinuities.  This program explores various methods to approach edge detection

## Overview
The main steps of edge detection are: (1) assign a score to each pixel; (2) find local maxima along the direction perpendicular to the edge. Sometimes a third step is performed where local evidence is propagated so that long contours are more confident or strong edges boost the confidence of nearby weak edges. Optionally, a thresholding step can then convert from soft boundaries to hard binary boundaries. Here are sample outputs.



**Hint:** Reading these papers will help understanding and may help with the programming.
